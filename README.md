# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

This project was my first introduction to CSS and UX in general. Along with connecting the server to mongo to make it more data-robust, it was fun to really key in on how users interact with your site. How things as basic as colour palete and interactive buttons really enhance the sense of connection with the user.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
